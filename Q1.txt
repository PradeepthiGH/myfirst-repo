This website page consists of a data table with International Indices and daily updates on fixed set of indices data
On daily basis, extract the data table from web page and store / update data  in excel

“DD-MMM-YYYY” means date of bot execution. In this case this will be daily
Bot should be scheduled to run daily at 9:00 pm IST
Output file should be saved in the folder “Market_Watch”
Bot should access this web page, create the output file for the first time and then must compare web page data with previous day data in excel and update changes in data into new excel workbook on daily basis (every day of the year).
Daily output file should be saved as excel workbook in the format as “DD-MMM-YYYY_MarketWatch_Indices_data.xlsx” to reflect current date of bot execution.
If there is no update in data on the web page compared to previous day data, then the filename for latest bot execution should be saved as “DD-MMM-YYYY_MarketWatch_Indices_data_NoChange.xlsx”
